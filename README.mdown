# Openboxy Alt-Tab

An extension for gnome-shell (3.10) that provides an Alt-tab implementation
inspired by that in Openbox.

It lacks any animations and feels super snappy.

This extension started off as a fork of CoverflowAltTab, but there's very little
similarity between them now. I might not have been able to create this extension
if not for CoverflowAltTab.
